## Disclaimer

These packages are maintained by Firedhat, who **is not a Goonstation Developer**. These are unofficial, automatically generated packages that aren't tested *at all*. If something's broken with them, [leave an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/firedhat/goon-nightly/issues/new) and hopefully I'll get around to it.

## Instructions

1. Open the ZIP Archive
2. Move the `goonstation` folder where you want.
3. **NEVER RENAME THE FOLDER**. It breaks everything.
3. Run `goonstation.dmb` (the BYOND executable)
4. You are an admin! Time for crime.

## Updating

Do the above instructions, but drag the new `goonstation` folder into the one you already have.
