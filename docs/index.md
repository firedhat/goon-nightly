If this says 'failed' then these packages won't be up-to-date.

## Disclaimer

These packages are maintained by Firedhat, who **is not a Goonstation Developer**. These are unofficial, automatically generated packages that aren't tested *at all*. If something's broken with them, [leave an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/firedhat/goon-nightly/issues/new) and hopefully I'll get around to it.

## Instructions

1. Open the ZIP Archive
2. Move the `goonstation` folder where you want.
3. **NEVER RENAME THE FOLDER**. It breaks everything.
3. Run `goonstation.dmb` (the BYOND executable)
4. You are an admin! Time for crime.

To update to a new version, do this again, but drag the new `goonstation` folder into the one you already have. Then replace the old files with the new one (be sure to check any 'do this for all files' option!)

## Tricks

- In the 'Server' tab there is a button to skip the pre-game lobby.
- You can spawn anything using the  `Spawn` verb.
    - `Spawn re/san` spawns the Captain's spare.
- In the 'Self' tab you can toggle lighting, noclip, and god mode.
- To control the shuttle or game mode, use the `Game-Panel` verb.
