# Goonstation Nightly

Some workflows that build and package Goonstation every night at 8pm Eastern. Go to the [website](https://firedhat.github.io/goon-nightly) for some download links.

## What, why, huh?

You can't test cron workflows without having the file on the primary branch, so this is mostly a test. If it's successful (and used by anyone) I will probably PR this to Goonstation itself.

## Do people even use this?

I dunno, I made this in late Sept 2023. We'll see.
